        <h1 class="big-text">About Us</h1>
        <p>TravelAir began with a simple idea: finding your destination should feel exciting, not overwhelming.

Years ago, our founder noticed how many people dreamed of traveling but felt lost in the planning process. Too many choices, unclear routes, hidden details, and confusing information often turned excitement into stress. Flights were booked, but confidence was missing. People knew they wanted to go somewhere — they just didn’t know the best way to get there.

That’s where TravelAir was born.

Starting as a small team with a shared passion for guidance and clarity, TravelAir set out to become more than just a travel service. We wanted to be a trusted guide. Someone who listens first, understands each traveler’s needs, and then carefully maps out the journey — from the first idea to the final destination.

In the early days, TravelAir focused on personalized support. Every client was treated like our only client. We learned that no two journeys are the same, and that the best travel experiences come from thoughtful planning, honest advice, and clear communication.

As word spread, TravelAir grew. What never changed was our mission: to help people travel with confidence. Today, we combine experience, technology, and human care to make every journey smoother and more meaningful.

At TravelAir, we don’t just help you book a trip — we help you find your direction, take off with confidence, and arrive exactly where you want to be.</p>
